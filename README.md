Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

Note on AI use: I used ChatGPT to ask technical questions like how to add numerical IDs to tasks or JavaScript syntax questions (like how to format Date into a more readable form). I also used it to understand JavaScript notation and for debugging purposes.

## Your Web Application Title
This project is a To-Do List application where users can add, delete, and edit tasks. I used CSS flexbox to position the form elements, buttons, and task items.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I created a single-page app that has a server that maintains a tabular dataset with the fields "title," "description," "due date," and "days until due".

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Using a combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, the application always shows the current state of the server-side data.

- **Tech Achievement 3**: Using a combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I created a form that allows users to submit data to the server, enabling them to add, delete, and edit tasks.

- **Tech Achievement 4**: Using Javascript, the application's server calculates the number of days before a task is due using the due date submitted by the user and the current date.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Sarah Malinoski (Friend)

Problems:
She didn't see the due date field at first, so she initially put the due date in the description, but then she realized and changed it.

Comments:
She noticed that the tasks aren't ordered by the due date, but they are ordered by the creation date.

I might add a due date label to make the interface more clear and an option to sort the tasks by the date due.


- **Design Achievement 2**: 
Fernanda Calix (Roommate)

Problems:
She ran into an issue where when she edits a task, the date picker UI doesn't show up. You can still enter the date using your keyboard, but it's a bug I should fix, especially since she wasn't able to figure it out and put the date in the description instead.

Comments:
She was able to add tasks successfully and smoothly.
She also mentioned that it would be nice if the application categorized the tasks by due date.

I would add the functionality to sort the tasks by due date and fix the bug on the date picker UI.
